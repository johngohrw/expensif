# Window size and how older days load

Type: grilling
Status: resolved
Blocked by: none

## Question

How many days is one window, and how does the next window back arrive?

The bounds are settled: anchor at today, walk backwards, no future days. What is not
settled is `N` and the loading mechanism. `DailyGroups(ctx, 100)`'s expense cap
cannot survive — 100 expenses is an unbounded number of days, and a window of days is
an unbounded number of expenses.

Resolve, one at a time:

- **N.** 30 days? A calendar month? Enough to fill a viewport and no more? Note that
  N is now the page-weight knob: every day in the window costs a card whether or not
  it has an expense.
- **Mechanism.** A `?before=YYYY-MM-DD` query param and a plain "Load older" link at
  the foot (server-rendered, no JS, matches the standing preference)? Or an infinite
  scroll island? The map rules out islands for *collapsing*; that ruling does not
  automatically extend to pagination — but it sets the burden of proof.
- **Append or replace.** Does "Load older" navigate to a new page showing the older
  window, or append to the current one? The former is trivial and stateless; the
  latter needs an island or `hx-`-style swap.
- **Does the current 100-expense limit have a defender?** Check whether anything else
  depends on `DailyGroups`' signature before changing it.

This ticket blocks the query shape, so it also owes an answer to: what does the
handler need to ask the repository for — a window of expenses, or a window of days?

## Answer

**Window is a rolling 30 days from today**: `[today-29, today]`. Always 30 cards, today
always first, no ragged first window. Month-alignment was rejected because on the 1st
of a month the first window would be one day tall.

**Older days arrive via a new infinite-scroll React island.** This overrides the map's
standing "server-render unless forced" preference — recorded as a deliberate choice by
the user, not an oversight. Plain-link options (`?days=` growing window, `?before=`
pages) were offered and declined.

**The island fetches JSON and renders appended day-cards in React.** A new endpoint
returns `[]domain.DailyGroup` for a date range. Rejected: fetching HTML fragments,
because `ui/src/entries/data-table.tsx` calls `init()` once at module load and
`querySelectorAll`s the document — appended `[data-table-root]` nodes would never
mount, and its `hydrateRoot` is the wrong call for freshly-fetched markup anyway.

**The first 30-day window stays server-rendered** by `daily.html`; the island only
appends windows below it. This keeps first paint fast and keeps muted empty-day cards
working without JS. The price is that day-card chrome (header, date, footer total)
is implemented twice — Go template and TSX. Accepted, and contained by ticket 06.

**Scrolling terminates at the earliest expense's day.** `svc.GetEarliestExpenseDate()`
already exists and is already used by `HandleCalendar`. Once a window reaches it, the
island stops requesting and the foot shows a terminal marker. No infinite scroll into
pre-history.

### Facts established (looked up, not asked)

- **`DailyGroups` has exactly one caller** — `handlers_html.go:264`, where `100` is a
  bare literal. Nothing defends the current signature. Ticket 04 may change it freely.
- **The repository needs no new SQL.** `ListExpensesInRange(ctx, start, end)`
  (`sqlite.go:69`) takes a date range with no `LIMIT`, and `HandleCalendar` already
  uses it for exactly this purpose. This also settles the map's "Query cost" fog: one
  `ExpensesInRange` per 30-day window is enough; no `GROUP BY date` aggregate needed.
- **The daily view's tables are already client-rendered React, not hydrated server
  markup.** `templates/partials/data-table.html` emits only `<div data-table-root>`
  with a JSON `<script>` and a `<noscript>` fallback — there is no server-rendered
  `<table>`. So this page already requires JS to display any expense, and the
  Go-template/TSX drift introduced above touches only day-card chrome, never tables.
- The app has **no pagination anywhere** today; this is the first.
- Gap-filling adds only static cards — empty days carry no `data-table` island — so
  window size drives markup weight, not hydration cost.
