# Expensif Context

Language for the Expensif expense-tracking domain. This is a personal / small-household expense tracker, so terms are deliberately plain and user-facing.

## Language

**Expense**:
A single purchase or payment recorded by a user. It has an amount, category, description, date, currency, and optionally a payer.
_Avoid_: transaction, record, entry

**Category**:
A user-defined label that groups expenses, such as "food" or "transport".
_Avoid_: tag, bucket

**Description**:
A short free-text note explaining what the expense was for, such as "lunch with team".
_Avoid_: memo, note, detail

**Currency**:
The ISO 4217 code in which an expense amount is recorded, e.g. USD, MYR, JPY.
_Avoid_: money, denomination

**User**:
A person tracked in the system. A user can be selected as the payer for an expense.
_Avoid_: account, profile, person (when used as a generic substitute)

**Payer**:
The user who paid for an expense. Recorded as `paidBy` / `paidById` on an expense.
_Avoid_: paid by, spender

**Preferred Currency**:
The currency chosen in Preferences, used to display converted totals across expenses recorded in different currencies.
_Avoid_: base currency, home currency

**Preferences**:
The singleton settings for the application: preferred currency, default payer, and timezone.
_Avoid_: settings, config

**Exchange Rate**:
The conversion rate from the base currency (USD) to a target currency, fetched from Frankfurter and cached per day.
_Avoid_: fx rate, conversion factor

**Converted Amount**:
The expense amount expressed in the preferred currency for display. It is computed at render time, not stored.
_Avoid_: normalized amount, display amount

**Daily View**:
A page that is date-indexed: every day in the Window appears, newest first, whether or not it carries an expense, with a subtotal per spending day. Empty days render as muted rows. Rendered as a Ledger.

**Ledger**:
The Daily View's single continuous layout — no cards. Each day is one row: an empty day is a muted single line with an always-visible add affordance; a spending day lists its expenses between two Rails with a right-aligned day total. Month transitions carry a heavier divider.
_Avoid_: table, feed, list

**Rail**:
A thin vertical line running the full height of a day's row in the Ledger. Two Rails frame the expenses column and, because days carry no padding between them, read as unbroken lines down the page.
_Avoid_: border, divider, gutter

**Window**:
The rolling 30-day range ending at today that the Daily View renders on first load (`[today-29, today]`). Older Windows load on demand via infinite scroll until the earliest expense is reached. The Window never extends past today.
_Avoid_: range, page, view

**Upcoming**:
Future-dated days, shown as an ungapped continuation of the Ledger *above* today, marked only by a tinted date and capped at the three days nearest today (the rest collapse into one overflow row linking to the Calendar View). There is no separate "Upcoming section" — it is the same Ledger continuing.
_Avoid_: scheduled, future section, forecast

**Calendar View**:
A monthly grid showing which days have expenses and how much was spent, using a heat map to encode magnitude.

**List View**:
A page showing all expenses in a single table with totals and conversion information.

**Category Suggestion**:
A recently used category offered as a quick-select pill in the add/edit form.

**Description Suggestion**:
A previously used description for a given category, offered as a quick-select pill in the add/edit form.

**Timezone**:
The IANA timezone (e.g. `Asia/Singapore`) used to compute "today", "yesterday", and calendar ranges. Dates are stored as bare `YYYY-MM-DD` strings; the timezone is applied at display time.
_Avoid_: locale, time offset

**Heat Level**:
A 1–5 quintile rank of a day's total spend relative to other days with any spend, used by the Calendar View to size and color the heat blob.
_Avoid_: intensity, score

**Island**:
A selectively hydrated interactive region mounted on an otherwise server-rendered HTML page. Each island has a named container and an entry script. Most islands are React components; the Daily View's infinite scroll is a vanilla-TypeScript island that fetches and appends server-rendered HTML (see ADR 0001).
_Avoid_: widget, component (when the specific partial-hydration pattern matters)

## Cross-Context Notes

- **Date vs. Time**: Expensif stores only a calendar date (`YYYY-MM-DD`). The timezone is a display concern, not part of the stored domain fact.
- **Amount vs. Converted Amount**: The amount recorded on an expense is immutable relative to the expense's own currency. The converted amount is a view-model value derived from the exchange rate at display time.
- **User vs. Payer**: A user is a person in the system; a payer is the role that person plays for a specific expense.
